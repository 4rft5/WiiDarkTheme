# WiiDarkTheme
A subtle dark theme for the Wii.

## Information
I personally find all the "Dark Themes" that are floating around a little *too* dark, most colors are just replaced with black and haphazardly put together, without a focus on the original Wii styling.

The purpose of creating this theme was to retain the Wii's characteristics in both style and feel.

It is possible to edit the files of this theme, as they are being shared here in their unpacked format. To edit more in-depth features, look into <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/theme-brlyt-editor-by-the-wii-theme-team-release.352615/"> Theme Brlyt Editor</a>

## Installation
**CAUTION! Installing Wii Themes has the potential to brick your system. Proceed with caution, and install precautionary measures, such as BootMii and Priiloader. See <a href="https://wii.hacks.guide/hbc.html">wii.hacks.guide</a> for more info.**

1. Download the entire folder from this repository, and use its contents (minus the README) to create a .zip, changing the file extension to .mym.

2. Download ThemeMii from the following link: <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/ThemeMii"> ThemeMii Download</a>

3. With ThemeMii open, select File, then choose Open, and select your .mym file.

4. With the mym file open, select "Create csm" and supply your .app file from wherever you get it. (If you don't know where to find this, look into <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/NUS_Downloader"> NUSDownloader</a>.)

5. Place your newly created csm file in your themes folder, and install it on your Wii.

Enjoy!
